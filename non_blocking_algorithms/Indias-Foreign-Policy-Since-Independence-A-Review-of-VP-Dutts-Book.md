Dutt analyzes the motivations, objectives, achievements, and limitations of India's foreign policy in a changing world order. He also offers some suggestions for improving India's foreign policy performance and image.
 
The book is written in an easy and engaging style, with ample references to primary and secondary sources. It is suitable for students, researchers, diplomats, and general readers who are interested in a comprehensive understanding of India's foreign policy since independence.

The book begins with a historical overview of India's foreign policy from ancient times to the colonial period, highlighting the continuity and change in India's worldview and interests. It then traces the development of India's foreign policy since independence, focusing on the role of Jawaharlal Nehru, the first prime minister and the chief architect of India's foreign policy. Dutt discusses Nehru's vision of a peaceful and cooperative world order, his advocacy of nonalignment and anti-colonialism, his handling of the Kashmir dispute and the border conflicts with Pakistan and China, and his contribution to the Afro-Asian solidarity and the United Nations.
 
The book then examines the foreign policy challenges and opportunities faced by India's successive prime ministers, such as Lal Bahadur Shastri, Indira Gandhi, Morarji Desai, Rajiv Gandhi, P.V. Narasimha Rao, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, Manmohan Singh, and Narendra Modi. Dutt evaluates their responses to the changing regional and global scenarios, such as the Cold War and its end, the emergence of new centers of power, the rise of terrorism and extremism, the globalization and liberalization of the economy, the nuclear proliferation and disarmament issues, the environmental and human rights concerns, and the diaspora and cultural diplomacy.
 
The book also explores the various dimensions and determinants of India's foreign policy, such as its national security and defense strategy, its economic and energy interests, its cultural and civilizational heritage, its democratic and secular values, its soft power and public diplomacy, and its aspirations for a greater role in global governance. Dutt assesses the strengths and weaknesses of India's foreign policy performance and image in dealing with different regions and countries of the world. He also identifies some of the emerging challenges and opportunities for India's foreign policy in the 21st century.
